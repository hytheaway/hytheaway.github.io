						<br>by the time this photo was taken, this was only a fight stick.
						<br>there were no components that had anything to do with music.
						<br>still, i was super thrilled i got anything to work.
						<br>
						<br>the new biggest hold up was how was i going to connect the buttons
						<br>to both the fight stick's usb controller <i>and</i> to the meap board?
						<br>
						<br>there are a few main components to the fight stick: the buttons and the joystick
						<br>connect to the cables which connects to the board/microcontroller.
						<br>
						<br>a button normally works by completing a circuit when pressed. some voltage goes
						<br>into the button, and then only passes through the button when it's pressed.
						<br>when the voltage passes, a button press is registered.
						<br>
						<br>looking at the microcontroller, i gathered it was sending +5v to the button on one pin,
						<br>and (presumably) the board would measure when those +5v went to ground on another pin.
						<br>the problem is that there was a third pin.
						<br>
						<br>since these buttons lit up, there was a pin dedicated to delivering power
						<br>to the leds under the button.
						<br>
						<br>as dumb as it is, this simply stumped me for a few days. i'm not the most acute
						<br>when it comes to industry norms in electronics at all.

						<br>the a-ha moment for me came while i was on break during a bartending class.
						<br>zooming in on this picture of my notebook will probably make most
						<br>properly trained circuit-designers cringe, but i was frantic to record my ramblings
						<br>
						<br><i>this information may be incorrect but it works for me.</i>
						<br>i realized that each button was basically just a series connection. the leds were
						<br>always on, so i knew that the +5v first went to the led. the voltage then leaves the
						<br>led (and goes into a resistor first, but that's less important) and enters one leg of
						<br>the button's switch. this leg connects to a pin on the bottom of the button, which goes to
						<br>a dedicated pin on the board/microcontroller. when this pin is receiving voltage,
						<br>the logic on the board determines that the button is not being pressed. however,
						<br>when this pin is <i>not</i> receiving voltage, then that means that the button
						<br>has been pressed, and the voltage post-led is going straight to ground.
						<br>
						<br>i think.

						<br>how long has it been?
						<br>
						<br>.days?
						<br>..months?
						<br>...years?
						<br>
						<br>how long since i last felt the kiss of sunlight upon my skin?
						<br>how long since i held the brim of a hat down as the wind rushed past?
						<br>how long since i felt the dew-adorned earth beneath my feet?
						<br>
						<br>i know not, for i am condemned to curiosity.
						<br>
						<br>the sun's light shall not be snuffed in a day. the wind will not cease on a whim.
						<br>the dew may not remove itself from the earth as a matter of principle.
						<br>neither, then, shall my motivation be extinguished.
						<br>
						<br>in the face of the known & unknown, i persevere. 
						<br>
						<br>---
						<br>
						<br>this stage felt like an eternity. my hands have never been all too steady,
						<br>and between repeated soldering, testing, and resoldering, i must've inhaled
						<br>a concerning amount of fumes.
						<br>well, maybe someone else's concern.
						<br>
						<br>i also added a few pass-thru ports: a usb c pass-thru for programming the
						<br>meap board, a couple buttons for reset and program, and a hole cut for the
						<br>fight stick microcontroller's usb type b port to pass thru.
						<br>
						<br>this stage also is where i learned some of the quirks of these boards. 
						<br>by far the largest "quirk" that utterly baffled me for nearly half an hour
						<br>was related to the new usb c port i had outfitted.
						<br>the meap board has a micro usb b port that's used to communicate with
						<br>the ESP32. when it came time to extend the port to the edge of the chassis,
						<br>i elected to use a usb c port on the chassis, and internally use a micro usb
						<br>to usb c adapter to connect the meap board to this pass thru. i figured since the
						<br>usb standard is, y'know, <i>standard</i>, this wouldn't be a problem.
						<br>
						<br>i've heard of this before, which is why i didn't spend even more time on things
						<br>but this meap board, in the configuration i have it, with the particular adapters
						<br>and pass-thru port i have, will not pass data unless the connected usb c cable
						<br>is usb a to usb c, obviously with the a side at the computer. usb c to c doesn't work.
						<br>it'll pass power, but not data. whatever.

						<br>the day it all comes together. and also the day i actually write code for once.
						<br>
						<br>i basically went into a fugue state for 9 hours and wrote the appropriate code, which
						<br> may be found <a href='https://github.com/hytheaway/cerialver2' target="_blank">here</a>.
						<br>
						<br>i will be the first to admit that i am not an expert in c or c++, and i am much
						<br>less an expert in programming microcontrollers, especially with dynamic instructions.
						<br>however, it functions, and as long as i don't touch it, it will continue to function.
