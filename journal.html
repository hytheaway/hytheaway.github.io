					<h3>the immersion question (jul 2024)</h3>
					<div class="flex-container" style='border-bottom: 2px dashed lightgrey;'>
						<div class="leftside" style="text-align: left;">
							<p style="font-size: 90%;">
								by far, the question that i dislike the most within the world of immersive audio.
								<br>
								<br>it's been a moment since i last posted. unfortunately, most of my time has been dedicated to projects that i am unable to talk about here, either for the time being or forever. however,
								there is always room to talk about one of the most infuriatingly meaningful and meaningless debates within the vast world of immersive audio:
								</p>
								<br><p style="text-align: center; font-size: 120%;" title="or, alternatively, what does it mean for audio to be immersive?">what makes audio immersive?</p>
								<br><p style="font-size: 90%;">on the surface, it's a pretty obvious question. i mean, clearly we need to work out what it means for something to be "immersive" before we can go around calling
								whatever we produce "immersive".
								<br>
								<br>okay, well, how about this:
								<span style="text-align: center;"><i>"audio is immersive if it takes advantage of the unique properties offered by immersive audio systems."</i></span>
								<br>yeah, this is definitely a good start, but still only getting about a little bit of the way there. but, what makes an audio system immersive? having a bunch of speakers? then, what about binaural
								audio? or VR audio? then, maybe an audio system is immersive if the audio sounds like it's coming from all around you. but then, that's not the system's doing, that's the content. and, if the quality
								of immersive is exclusively content-based, then how do we distinguish systems that are built with immersive content in mind?
								<br>
								<br>so, the answer must be either somewhere in-between "audio is immersive if the system is immersive" and "audio is immersive if it sounds immersive", or must be encompassing of both.
								<br>
								<br>the topic is still very much up for debate (or more accurately, interpretation), but people seem to have generally landed on a definition that includes both, delving specifically into the psychoacoustic attributes
								of immersion. in some technical way, an audio system is only immersive if it's capable of delivering an immersive experience, which could be done with as few as one speaker/sound source.
								but, that's at odds with the commerical market, which has specifically created a subset of "immersive audio" products that center around multichannel configurations and their folddowns to binaural.
								<br>
								<br>ultimately, this ambiguity will be either difficult or entirely impossible to resolve, and it's not so much a matter of narrow or broad interpretations.
								what consitutues an "immersive" experience to one person may not evoke the same reaction to another. one person might find a stereo mix utterly all-encompassing, while
								another might find it flat and unconvincing. likewise, two different people, both perfectly in the sweet spot, may not agree on how compelling an atmos mix is. 
								<br>
								<br>this makes it sound like i'm on the side of those who believe that the content is what makes audio immersive, regardless of its associated technical capabilities.
								in that case, it would be easy to say that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does" target="_blank">the purpose of a system is what it does</a>,
								and to end the conversation there.
								<br>
								<br>however, i cannot entirely agree with that perspective, because a full adoption of that mentality inherently either states that for each person in the world, there is at least one piece of audio
								content that they would describe as "immersive" (to the same or nearly the same extent as if it were played back on an immersive system), even if it was played back on a system not intended for immersive audio experiences,
								or states that there are some people with full faculites intact who cannot experience audio as immersive.
								if a person requires a purpose-built immersive audio system in order to experience audio as immersive, then that demonstrates that content alone is not sufficient in
								creating an immersive experience.
								<br>
								<br>on the other hand, it can be an equally poor perspective to believe that what makes audio immersive is the system its played back on. i don't imagine the reasons
								for this are all too difficult to determine, but this perspective's simplest and most compelling failing is that, no matter how many speakers or
								orders you have, a bad multichannel/binaural mix will never be immersive.
								<br>remember that the purpose of a system is what it does.
								therefore, an immersive audio system that fails to always produce immersive audio is not an immersive audio system. it is, at best, a "sometimes immersive audio system".
								<br>
								<br><span style="text-align: center;">so, why do i hate this question so much?</span>
								<br>cause it sucks, dude.
								<br>
								<br>there's no concrete answer to it, and that's not a bad thing by itself. what makes that a bad thing is that, because there's no concrete answer to it (and in my opinion, there never will),
								people <i>love</i> to spend all their time in a circle with their hands on their chins postulating on the meaning on immersion and life and humanity and its applicability to audio, instead of
								going out there and actually putting those good brains to proper use. these people (a vocal minority, i will add) <i><b>thrive</b></i> on the very nature of this unanswerable question, because it means that they get to push their thoughts forward,
								hear themselves speak, correct other people, trample over unrelated conversations, but ultimately take no responsibility for any of it under the pretense of "well, it <i>is</i> an unanswerable question" with a <span title="read: shit-eating grin" style="display: inline;">smirk</span> on their face.
								the question of "what makes audio immersive" becomes the ulimate game of "ummm, actually" in a desperate attempt to prove themselves more knowledgable about a
								wholly self-constructed classification, topic, and argument, and it's completely disengaging to anyone trying to get a feel for this field.
								<br>
								<br>yes, it's an important question, but what good is that if no one actually cares about the answer? has the lack of an answer stopped literally anyone from progressing research in the field?
								has the lack of an answer prevented any company from attempting to establish a vertical for themselves in this brand new form of content creation and consumption? in fact, the lack of an answer
								doesn't even prevent any single content creator from engaging in the field. but these petulant, pedantic, self-aggrandizing <span id="profanity" style="display: none;" onmouseout="this.style.display='none'; membersOfMutual.style.display='inline'"><b>circlejerking self-proclaimed "intellectuals"</b></span><span id="membersOfMutual" style="font-family: 'snell roundhand', cursive; font-size: 120%; display: inline; background: url(assets/censor10.gif) repeat-x;" onmouseover="this.style.display='none'; profanity.style.display='inline'">members of a mutual admiration society</span> certainly
								<i>do</i> prevent greener individuals from creating the very content that this field is so desperately in need of.
								<br>
								<br>honestly, these people are a small, small, small subset of those discussing the question of immersion. there have been some amazing papers published that do make a genuine effort to investigate the qualities of immersion, and how best to apply those
								finding to content created for immersive experiences. i've long felt that the question is important but the debate isn't.
								the field of immersive audio has reached a point where the technology is having a difficult time developing any further without a sizeable amount of content being produced for it,
								and while most of the reason for that (in my opinion) has to do with the significant workflow changes associated with creating immersive content, we should be focusing on
								minimizing any and every other deterrant for newcomers. no one wants to pour their valuable time and energy into a field they are constantly being told they don't understand.
								<br>
								<br>you don't need to educate every person you meet. people won't remember you for being smart, but they will remember you for being overbearing. so many people involved in this field are smart in so many ways. distinguish yourself by being kind.
								because, in a world where you can be anything, why would you choose to be anything but kind?

								and it is!
								<br>i mean, over function, for sure.
								<br>
								<br>anyone purchasing a ps2 keyboard in the year 2024 probably knows that:
								<br>- they're incompatible with modern computers
								<br>- they don't support hotswap, so anytime it's plugged in or unplugged, the computer has to be restarted
								<br>- usb compatibility relies on third party dongles that are often hit or miss 
								<br>- the price of good quality ps2 keyboards is rising
								<br>
								<br>but when i was walking back to my apartment the other day, i stopped by a hardware shop to search for any fine point soldering tips (long shot, i know, but it was on the way), when i met face to face with this beauty, still in the box. no surprise there, though. <a href="https://www.chicony.com/chicony/en/Product/Input*Device/Wired*entry*keyboard" target="_blank">these are still manufactured, after all</a>.
								<br>
								<br>but, hey, how often do you get to try out a rubber dome keyboard that looks straight out of the 80s?

								akin to that one flight i took that one time.
								<br>overwhelmingly exciting for what's ahead, but a bit of a rocky start.
								<br>
								<br>reproducing "retro" consoles with fpgas at incredibly accessible prices is an amazing future that i hope to see.
								<br>i can't imagine the complexity associated with reverse engineering a console at all, though.
								<br><a href="https://www.analogue.co/">analogue has been doing this for years</a>, but their business model has devolved to scarcity tactics, 
								their prices are insane <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogueInc/comments/xgu7pi/analogues_shipping_prices_are_outrageous/'>(with reportedly absurd shipping prices)</a>
								and their marketing revolves around the idea that their products are "no emulation". my reach is limited, but let me communicate this clearly:
							</p>
							<p style="text-align: center;">
								<b>hardware emulation <i>is</i> emulation.</b>
							</p>
							<p style="font-size: 90%;">
								they even clarify that their products use no <i>software</i> emulation in the small print of their website - they're <i>aware</i> that this claim is unambiguously false.
								<br>
								<br>hardware emulation does suffer from inaccuracy issues, the exact same way that software emulation does. 
								<a href="https://endrift.com/2021/12/13/analogue-pocket-hate-story/">inaccurate (albeit infrequent) cycle speeds</a>, 
								<a href="https://github.com/ninbura/pokemon-on-the-analogue-pocket">rtc</a>, 
								<a href="https://twitter.com/krikzz/status/1473050368154255373">write/read compatibility</a>, 
								<a href='https://github.com/frederic-mahe/Analogue-Pocket/issues/21'>color reproduction</a>, etc. - these all contribute to a less than 
								authentic experience, <u><b>and the analogue pocket is no different.</b></u>
								and yet, it seems like all i hear about the analogue products is from people frothing at the mouth saying "but it's not emulation so it's better!!1!", and analogue directly
								benefits from this misconception.
								<br>
								<br>so, i'm not about to drop $220 (+$60 shipping!!!) on a product i don't need, to support a company whose business practices i believe are immoral, and whose marketing tactics so carefully dance 
								the line of deception that it's remarkable all they've been required to disclaim is in small print on their website.
								<br>
								<br>so. <a href='https://funnyplaying.com/products/fpgbc-kit'>the funnyplaying fpgbc</a>.
								<br>imagine if the analogue pocket was maybe 10% worse at it's aimed goal, about 120% less expensive, and about 50% more fun.
								<br>at like $85 all in, with free shipping, it's not just one of the easiest diy kits for the gameboy family, but you also don't need to have a gameboy or gbc to mod.
								<br>this entire device is kind of sold as if it's just another mod kit for gbc, but no - it's entirely its own console.
								<br>
								<br>that's not to say it's without it's issues.
								<br>the most glaring one is that it doesn't seem to work with most reliable flash carts, including krikzz's everdrive-gb, and the ez-flash junior (which is the one i have).
								<br>beyond that, there are a few options for the display, including 4x integer scaling and a non-integer scaled view that fills the whole screen, which obviously
								will include shimmering, but honestly, i don't care about that. it looks amazing filling up the whole screen. so what's the problem? well, for each of the sizing options, there's a version that includes a color profile that attempts to emulate what a gameboy color looks like.
								<br>it's honestly not worth complaining about - just don't use it. turn it off, and don't turn it back on. it doesn't look good, i don't feel like it's particularly
								accurate, and i await a day when a firmware update patches it properly.
								<br>
								<br>i've had the fpgbc in my backpack with my copy of pokémon crystal since i put it together, and i've loved it. maybe my cartridge is borked, but the rtc doesn't work.
								i haven't tried it with my actual gameboy color (see <a href="#dec2023">dec2023 entry</a>), so while i cannot fathom why it would be an issue with the fpgbc, i still don't care to rule it out
								as a possibility.
								<br>i do believe that the best game console is the one you have with you, the same way the best flashlight is the one you have with you, the best knife is the one you have with you, etc. etc.,
								so it should come as no surprise that this has quickly become my more favorite game console recently, even with its flashcart shortcomings.
								<br>
								<br>love this little thing.
