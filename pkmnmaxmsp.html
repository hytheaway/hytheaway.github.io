                        alright let's explain this mess.
                        <br>i've never been the best at max, but this is functional.
                        <br>and sometimes that's all you can ask for.
                        <br>this patch can be broken up into three major chunks: the top, the middle, and the bottom.
                        <br>the patcher is centered around a camera - it won't do much of anything without one active.
                        <br>---
                        <br><b>the top.</b>
                        <br>- all the attached video devices are indexed by max with getvdevlist.
                        <br>- then, a jitter object is created with jit.grab and its dimensions.
                        <br>- the drop down box lists all the connected video devices (which were indexed earlier), and they're received by max
                        <br>with the dimensions listed by the jit.grab object
                        <br>which, after selecting the video device, is then sent back into the object to be portrayed onto the object's canvas.
                        <br>- the jit.grab object (which is now just displaying whatever you've fed it) is sent to 4 jit.matrix objects which
                        <br>take all those pixels you sent them and forces them to be 320x288. 
                        <br>- but wait! at the same time, each jit.matrix <i>also</i> gets fed some user determined coordinates. each jit.matrix gets
                        <br>4 coordinates - a top left corner's x&y, and a bottom right corner's x&y.
                        <br>- because either max or jitter or computers in general are not that good at being perfect, i also have a bunch of
                        <br>buttons that force these dimensions in place, since they seem to get lost sometimes.
                        <br><b>the middle.</b>
                        <br>this part is simple! we have 4 jit.pwindow objects, and the output of each of the 4 matrices gets sent to the input
                        <br>of each pwindow, so it just displays whatever was already within that matrix. i have them arranged in this pretty
                        <br>format, but they can be moved around, too. you may have noticed i did skip over one object earlier - the qmetro object.
                        <br>in this case, it's just serving as a clock. each pulse pushes a new frame. i felt it was better to bring that up here
                        <br>since it's easier to visualize.
                        <br><b>the bottom.</b>
                        <br>this is where all the audio processing is, really. the pwindow objects output a matrix of data about whatever is currently
                        <br>on the screen. the multiplexer object takes two matrices and combines them into one, and the release object takes a stream
                        <br>of data and converts it into a signal. the peek object takes that signal and converts it into an audio signal, which is
                        <br>then combined with the game audio signal (which is coming from the adc object), and <i>then</i> it's all sent to this cute lil
                        <br>granulizer before finally being output.
