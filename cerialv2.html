						<br>by the time this photo was taken, this was only a fight stick.
						<br>there were no components that had anything to do with music.
						<br>still, i was super thrilled i got anything to work.
						<br>
						<br>the new biggest hold up was how was i going to connect the buttons
						<br>to both the fight stick's usb controller <i>and</i> to the meap board?
						<br>
						<br>there are a few main components to the fight stick: the buttons and the joystick
						<br>connect to the cables which connects to the board/microcontroller.
						<br>
						<br>a button normally works by completing a circuit when pressed. some voltage goes
						<br>into the button, and then only passes through the button when it's pressed.
						<br>when the voltage passes, a button press is registered.
						<br>
						<br>looking at the microcontroller, i gathered it was sending +5v to the button on one pin,
						<br>and (presumably) the board would measure when those +5v went to ground on another pin.
						<br>the problem is that there was a third pin.
						<br>
						<br>since these buttons lit up, there was a pin dedicated to delivering power
						<br>to the leds under the button.
						<br>
						<br>as dumb as it is, this simply stumped me for a few days. i'm not the most acute
						<br>when it comes to industry norms in electronics at all.

						<br>the a-ha moment for me came while i was on break during a bartending class.
						<br>zooming in on this picture of my notebook will probably make most
						<br>properly trained circuit-designers cringe, but i was frantic to record my ramblings
						<br>
						<br><i>this information may be incorrect but it works for me.</i>
						<br>i realized that each button was basically just a series connection. the leds were
						<br>always on, so i knew that the +5v first went to the led. the voltage then leaves the
						<br>led (and goes into a resistor first, but that's less important) and enters one leg of
						<br>the button's switch. this leg connects to a pin on the bottom of the button, which goes to
						<br>a dedicated pin on the board/microcontroller. when this pin is receiving voltage,
						<br>the logic on the board determines that the button is not being pressed. however,
						<br>when this pin is <i>not</i> receiving voltage, then that means that the button
						<br>has been pressed, and the voltage post-led is going straight to ground.
						<br>
						<br>i think.
