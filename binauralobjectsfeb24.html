            <p style="text-align: center;">and the demands involved.</p>

                        well, the first demand is lugging the damn thing around.
                        <br>
                        <br>i mean, no one really tells you how cumbersome a head is until you're the one
                        <br>attempting to remain inconspicuous on the subway with a featureless, decapitated
                        <br>facsimile of a head in a roadcase. and it's not just the weight of it - the head is
                        <br>heavy enough, sure, but the weight of the sins you carry everyday makes its heft
                        <br>a negligable task.
                        <br>
                        <br>no, it's the unwieldiness of it all. the roadcase's clasps just barely hanging on,
                        <br>jangling against the side of your hip as if threatening to become undone at any moment,
                        <br>spilling this severed head and its guts (cables) all over the very public and very policed
                        <br>mode of transportation you've resigned yourself to.
                        <br>
                        <br>it's the anxiety, swiftly drenching your hand in a cold sweat once you mindlessly google the price of
                        <br>the apparatus, naturally weakening your hand and making it all the more likely that you lose your
                        <br>grip and inadvertently drop the poor man's head from a height that most newborns wouldn't survive.
                        <br>
                        <br>it's the stress associated with missing your stop after losing your focus to a train of
                        <br>thought hellbent on ascertaining the whereabouts of his other body parts. i mean, after all,
                        <br>brüel & kjær <i>made sure</i> his counterpart still has his torso. am i really meant to
                        <br>believe whatever story neumann makes up about his other body parts? unlikely.
                        <br>they must be hoarding his arms and legs, saving his torso and appendages for some grand feast.
                    </p>

                        seizing your own attention back from... ... ...whatever depths you just came from, the weight
                        <br>is hardly insurmountable, and as long as you keep your wits about you, you should be fine.
                        <br>
                        <br>besides, you've arrived at your destination, and it's time to <button id="start">start.</button>
